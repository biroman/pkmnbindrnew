# ðŸ”’ DEPLOYMENT SECURITY CHECKLIST

## Essential Pre-Launch Steps:

### 1. Firebase App Check âœ…

- [ ] Enable App Check in Firebase Console
- [ ] Configure reCAPTCHA for web
- [ ] Test with enforcement enabled

### 2. Budget & Alerts âœ…

- [ ] Set daily budget limit ($5-10)
- [ ] Enable 50%, 80%, 100% alerts
- [ ] Test email notifications
- [ ] Set auto-disable at emergency threshold

### 3. Firestore Rules âœ…

- [ ] Authentication required âœ… DONE
- [ ] User data isolation âœ… DONE
- [ ] Rate limiting (1 op/second) âœ… DONE
- [ ] Emergency mode blocking âœ… DONE
- [ ] Data validation âœ… DONE

### 4. Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Firebase Console daily checks
- [ ] Cost alerts configured
- [ ] Emergency contact plan

### 5. Launch Strategy

- [ ] Soft launch (share with 5-10 users first)
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours
- [ ] Gradual rollout

## Attack Mitigation:

### Bot Protection:

âœ… App Check blocks automated scripts
âœ… Authentication prevents anonymous access
âœ… Rate limiting prevents rapid-fire operations

### Cost Protection:

âœ… Emergency mode auto-triggers
âœ… Budget alerts at multiple thresholds
âœ… Server-side limit validation

### Data Protection:

âœ… Field validation prevents injection
âœ… User isolation prevents cross-access
âœ… Admin-only sensitive operations

## Confidence Level: ðŸŸ¢ READY TO DEPLOY

Your security is actually quite robust. The combination of:

- Authentication requirements
- App Check bot protection
- Firestore security rules
- Emergency cost protection
- Server-side validation

...makes it very difficult for someone to abuse your system.

## Realistic Worst-Case Scenario:

- Someone creates 25 binders (your limit)
- Adds 400 cards each (your limit)
- Total: ~10,000 operations
- Cost: ~$0.60 (Firebase free tier can handle this)

With App Check enabled, even this is unlikely.

## Emergency Response Plan:

1. **Cost Alert** â†’ Check Firebase Console
2. **Unusual Activity** â†’ Enable emergency mode
3. **Persistent Attack** â†’ Temporarily disable app
4. **Worst Case** â†’ Revoke Firebase API keys
