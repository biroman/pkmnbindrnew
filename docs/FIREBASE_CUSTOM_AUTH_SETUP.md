# Firebase Custom Authentication Pages Setup

This guide explains how to configure Firebase to use your custom professional authentication pages instead of the default Firebase UI.

## Overview

By default, Firebase Auth sends users to generic Firebase-hosted pages for:

- Password reset
- Email verification
- Account recovery

This setup redirects users to your custom branded pages that match your app's design.

## 🔧 Firebase Console Configuration

### Step 1: Access Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Templates**

### Step 2: Configure Email Templates

#### For Password Reset:

1. Click on **Password reset**
2. Click **Edit template**
3. In the **Action URL** section, change from:

   ```
   Default Firebase URL
   ```

   To:

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/auth/action
   ```

   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

4. Click **Save**

#### For Email Verification:

1. Click on **Email address verification**
2. Click **Edit template**
3. In the **Action URL** section, change from:

   ```
   Default Firebase URL
   ```

   To:

   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/auth/action
   ```

4. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Configure Authorized Domains

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
2. Add your production domain: `yourdomain.com`
3. For development, `localhost` should already be included
